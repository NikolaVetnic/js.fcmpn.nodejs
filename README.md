# Firebase Cloud Messaging Push Notifications Example

This is an example of using Firebase Cloud Messaging in Node.js to send a notification to a specific device running the Enmeshed app.

This code uses the Firebase Admin SDK to send the notification. It is not the desired way to send notifications to the Enmeshed app, but it is a working example that may be useful in the future.

This is a working example on 7 July 2023.
